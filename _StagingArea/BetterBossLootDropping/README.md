# BetterBossLootDropping

Don't like people stealing your boss loot?<br>
* Your loot will go straight into inventory.
* Loot is split between living players only.

You'd like your boss loot to drop in the same way as items from the Scav bag do?
* You can enable scav-like item dropping by disabling "Loot into inventory".

<br>
Works with RiskOfOptions, recommend installing it.



## Changelog

**1.0.0**

* Initial release.
